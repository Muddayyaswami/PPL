A-2 Conditional Jumps and Control Flow Graphs
---------------------------------------------

        Compile the following program (file A-2.c) and observe the GIMPLE dumps.

        Source file : A-2.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-gimple A-2.c
        View result : vi -O A-2.c A-2.c.*.gimple
        Clear dumps : rm -f A-2.c.* A-2.o

program
-------

        int Z;

        void f()
        {
	        int a, b, c;
	        a = Z;
	        if (a < 10) {
		        b = 5;
		        c = 17;
	        } else {
		        b = 6;
		        c = 20;
		        if (a == 0) {
			        c = 0;
		        }
	        }
	        Z = b * 10 + c;
        }
	

Questions
---------

        1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?
        ans: if-else blocks are converted into conditional gotos which have specific labels 
             in the gimple dump.  Contional gotos always have 2 labels for the taken and Not
             taken branches in the if-else blocks while unconditional gotos  go to the specified
             line without checking any condition.

        2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.

            Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg A-2.c
            View result : vi -O A-2.c A-2.c.*.cfg
        Ans 2: It is now easier to understand gimples using cfg dump as it is more
               simplied in syntax but contains more lines of code than earlier one.
            
***Note***  From here  onwards we will only  look at passes from  "cfg" onwards,
            each of which uses a CFG-based representation using basic blocks.
            
            
Additional Problem
------------------

        Try to figure  out how GCC handles the  ternary operator [a ? b  : c] in
        GIMPLE.

        
        ans: It converts ternanry operator into conditional goto which assign value to temporary
               variable which later gets assigned to the main variable ie x in this case.
