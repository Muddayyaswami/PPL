A-3 Loops
---------

        Compile the following program (file A-3.c) and observe the dumps.

	Source file : A-3.c
	Compilation : g4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg A-3.ccc-
	View result : vi -O A-3.c A-3.c.*.cfg
	Clear dumps : rm -f A-3.c.* A-3.o

Program
-------

        int main()
        {
    	    int sum = 0;
    	    int i, j;
    
    	    while(sum < 100) {
    		    sum = sum * 2;
    	    }
    
    	    for(i=0; i<25; i++) {
    		    for(j=0; j<50; j++) {
    			    sum = sum + i*j;
    		    }
    	    }
        }

Questions
---------

        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
		Ans:bb3 and bb4 correspond to while loop. bb2 avoids executing an iteration
		    unconditionally by having an unconditional goto to bb4 which is while loop
			conditional. This is the main difference between while and if-else which seems 
			to be always conditional. 


        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
		Ans: 
    		 BB 5:  Outer loo p induction variable initialisation
  			 BB 10: Outer loop conditional check
  			 BB 6:  Inner loop induction variable initialisation
  			 BB 8:  Inner loop conditional check
   			 BB 7:  Inner loop body + induction variable increment
   			 BB 9:  Outer loop induction variablent increment
			there isn't any noticable difference between for loop and while loop
			in cfg dump file both are executed in same manner.
